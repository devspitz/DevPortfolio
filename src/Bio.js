                    When working with me on a project you'll notice my critical thinking, strong communication skills and analytical
                    abilities. You will also notice that working under pressure with a flexible, positive
                    attitude are key strong points for me.<br />
                    With training in both front-end and back-end
                    programming, I'm proficient in a great variety of
                    programming languages, with a special interest in the MERN stack.<br />
                    I am eager to invest myself in a junior software
                    development position.
